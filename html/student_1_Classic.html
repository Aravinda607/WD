It is characterized by its use of orchestral instruments, such as violins, cellos, flutes, and pianos, and its emphasis on melody, harmony, and rhythm.
            One of the defining features of classical music is its adherence to musical forms, such as the sonata, symphony, concerto, and opera. These forms provide a structure that allows composers to express themselves within certain guidelines while still creating unique and innovative pieces of music.Classical music has been around for hundreds of years, and it has had a significant impact on music as we know it today. Many of the techniques and forms used in classical music have been adopted by other genres, such as jazz, rock, and pop music.
            Some of the most famous classical composers include Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Frederic Chopin. Their works are still widely performed and admired today, and their contributions to music continue to inspire new generations of musicians and composers.
