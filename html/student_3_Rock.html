    <h2>Rock Music</h2>

    <div class="main-para">
      <p>
        Rock music is a genre of popular music that emerged in the United States in the 1950s and has since spread
        throughout the world. It is characterized by the use of electric guitars, bass guitars, drums, and often
        keyboards and/or other instruments, as well as a strong emphasis on vocals.

        Rock music has its roots in several genres of American music, including blues, country, and gospel. Early rock
        musicians were influenced by these styles, as well as by the emerging youth culture of the time. Rock music
        quickly became associated with rebellion and a rejection of mainstream values, and it has continued to be
        associated with these themes throughout its history.

        <p>
          Since rock music first appeared in the late 1940s and early 1950s, it has undergone substantial change. Its
          origins can be linked to a fusion of several musical genres, including gospel, country, rhythm and blues, and
          blues. Early rock musicians like Chuck Berry and Little Richard strongly drew from African American musical
          traditions, influencing the genre.

          Rock music started to divide into various sub-genres in the 1960s as the genre grew in popularity, including
          psychedelic rock, folk rock, and hard rock. At this time, bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The
          Who rose to fame as icons for breaking barriers and creating new sounds.At GrooveGalaxy, we believe in
          celebrating the
          evolution of rock music and showcasing its diverse range of styles and forms. Our extensive music library

        <p>
          Overall, the evolution of rock music has been marked by constant innovation and experimentation, as artists continue to push the boundaries of what is possible within the genre.
